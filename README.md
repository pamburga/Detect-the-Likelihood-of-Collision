# Detect-the-Likelihood-of-Collision
In LA, traffic collisions threaten safety and city function. Our research analyzes 2010-present collision data, revealing patterns and predicting future incidents. Scrutinizing timing, locations, and demographics, we pinpoint hotspots for informed urban safety. Our insights align with urban development and public health goals.

Unzip Traffic_Collision_Data_from_2010_to_Present.csv.zip and place the Traffic_Collision_Data_from_2010_to_Present.csv file in the same directory as the ipynb files before running the code.
